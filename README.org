#+title: mpv-egui

*NOTE: This is a proof-of-concept. The code is not well-written.*

There is a lack of details on how to render MPV in Rust (successfully), so I synthesised existing examples to work in ~glutin~.
This repo serves a a PoC on using ~libmpv-sys~ in Rust with other libraries. I cannot guarantee that my PoC is very safe, because
of the heavy use of ~std::mem::transmute~, but the code here is functional and renders video.

This repo also serves as a PoC to overlay ~egui~ onto a running video in ~libmpv-rs~.
